## What is Practigo
A practical way to learn Go. Go, also known as Golang, is quickly becoming one of the most popular and one of the most loved programming languages. In 2021, Stack Overflow named it the 5th most loved programming language, and also as the 3rd most wanted programming language. With its simple yet powerful syntax, it's no wonder that the language keeps getting adopted by more and more people and companies. 

Practigo aims at teaching Golang in a more example oriented way. Because of the simplicity in Golang's syntax, if you already know a programming language or languages, it is not too diffocult to pick up. By using Practigo, one can quickly become accustomed with the syntax by going through examples and using the built in auto checker. 

## Getting Started
Getting started with Practigo could not be easier. First, makes sure you have Go installed on your computer. To check this, open a terminal on Mac/Linux or Command Prompt in Windows, and type 

```bash
go version
```

If it is not installed, visit https://golang.org and install Go.

Then, run the following commands
```
git clone https://github.com/simar-singh/Practigo
cd Practigo/app
sh run.sh
```

If there are no errors, you are all setup.

## Usage
In the directory Practigo/app/exercises there are numerous exercises designed to help you learn Golang quick. The first set of exercises is in the variables folder. Once you solve the problem, run `sh run.sh` to check your answer. 

That is it. You are all set to start using Practigo! 

## Technologies Used
For the App itself:
* Written entirely in Golang! Since the user would need Go installed, also having the application written in Go would be more efficient and can serve as extra resources for mastering the language

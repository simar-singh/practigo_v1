More and more companies, projects, and people are adopting it everyday, and it has recieved an overwhelming amount of positivity. With its simplistic syntax combined with the numerous amount of application make it an easy choice for many people. \n\nBecause of this, people should be able to learn this language in ways they would enjoy it. This project aims at teaching people the basics of Go syntax in an example oriented way. If you already know a programming language or languages, this should be perfect with you. Using the example problems and auto checker, learning Go has never been easier.</p>"
